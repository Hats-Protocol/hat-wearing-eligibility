# Hat Wearing Eligibility

A [Hats Protocol](https://github.com/hats-protocol/hats-protocol) eligibility module that conditions eligibility for one hat based on wearing another hat.

## Overview and Usage

One use of a hat is to serve as an encapsulation of a set of logic and conditions that serve as baseline eligibility criteria for other hats. This eligibility module builds on that idea by allowing a hat to be used as an eligibility criterion for another hat.
